NOW
OK adding a panettone nature to a project should not automatically add target/view-classes if it already exists
> when a file is removed, remove that file and nothing else. do not compile anything else
- src/main/views
> when a file is compiled, compile a single tone


Eclipse:
> automatically add popupmenu to add Panettone Nature to a project
- create your update site
- allow custom imports
- allow custom version of panettone jar (use the project's own file, if found)


pANETTONE:
- make panettone support .tone.*
-- adde default imports such as javautil
- add docs to panettone
