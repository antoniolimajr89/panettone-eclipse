Eclipse:
1. allow custom version of panettone jar (use the project's own file, if found)
2. automatically add popupmenu to add Panettone Nature to a project
5. create your update site

pANETTONE:
3. plugin automatically download jar if not yet present
4. doc explaining plugin

LATER:
- removing a tone.html is not deleting the java file
- project clean is not deleting everything
